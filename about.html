      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>This space is a quiet place for our words.</p>

      <p>
        We’re part of a creative writing club, and this blog exists as a home for the things we write...
        poems, short reflections, little slivers of thought, and pieces that start life in a physical journal
        before finding their way here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some entries are recent. Some were written months, possibly even years ago, and shared later.
        Posts appear when they were written, not when they were uploaded.
      </p>

      <p>If you’re reading this, thank you for taking the time to sit with our work.</p>

      <p>
        Love,<br>
        Marian, Gloria, Zeynep, Ian, Julian, and Tristan<br>
