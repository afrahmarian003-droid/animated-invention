      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>hi, this is a shared space for our writing!</p>

      <p>
        a place to collect short poems or quotes scribbled onto the corner of your notebook, short stories about experiences and emotion, little things about your day you found joy in even, anything you felt was worth writing down.
      </p>

      <p>
       you can share past or present work which means some entries may be recent or written months, possibly even years ago, and shared later through the submissions dropdown menu. Entries can be written in whatever language you'd prefer because sometimes thoughts arrive more honestly in the language they were thought in. On that note, if you'd rather a piece be uploaded anonymously, feel free to use the anonymous section on the dropdown menu and your name will be redacted from the post! 
    
      </p>

      <p>If you’re reading this, thank you for taking the time to sit with our work.</p>

      <p>
        Love,<br>
        Marian, Gloria, Zeynep, Ian, Julian, and Tristan<br>
