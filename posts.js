    excerpt: "grief, memory loss, and years that my mind refused to archive.",
    body: `There are entire years of my life I can’t seem to access without physical proof.

From around 2021 to 2023, my memory didn’t so much fade as it totally caved in on itself. When people ask what I was doing then, who I was seeing, or how I felt… I’d reach for answers the same way you’d reach for a light switch in a room you know is familiar, only to find there’s nothing there. No light switch. Just an outline of things that must have existed. 

This isn’t forgetfulness in its usual sense. It isn’t misplacing your house keys or forgetting your neighbours name. It’s an absence of character and texture. No order. No emotional progression. Time happened, i mean, clearly… my body aged, my phone filled up, my life moved forward, but my mind refused to archive any of it.

Grief did that.

Grief is always spoken about as this sort of sadness, as a longing, as pain. We don’t talk enough about how it erases. How it quietly interferes with the brain’s ability to encode an experience. And how it says “survival first, memory later… or never”.

During those years, I had functioned, worked, spoke, and laughed at socially acceptable moments. I was perceived by those around me to be “coping”, which is often code for “not making anyone uncomfortable”. But internally, something had shut down. My mind stopped filing important moments away because it didn’t trust the future enough to believe they’d ever be needed.

Memory needs safety. Grief annihilates that.

When your nervous system is overwhelmed, the brain prioritises endurance and capability. It narrows your focus to the things you need. It dulls sensation. Is this why people who go through traumatic experiences often describe a similar thing? a blur. Days that fold and intertwine within each other. Months that feel like one long, tedious afternoon. It’s not that nothing happened, it’s that my mind decided it wasn’t important enough to remember.

I know that those years existed because of artefacts.

A photo snaps something in me loose. A video reanimates this version of myself I don’t seem to remember inhabiting. Sometimes I’ll watch myself speaking, smiling, singing, or standing in a place I don’t recognise and it feels less like nostalgia and moreso like discovery. “Oh. I was there.
I had a body then too.”

Without these physical artefacts, those years may as well dissolve entirely. My memory now relies on external storage: camera rolls, messages, timestamps. Proof that I lived days I can’t internally recover.

It’s quite unsettling in all honesty, realising that your own mind can’t be trusted as an archive.

But it’s also strangely tender in and of itself.

Because what if the memory loss isn’t failure… it’s protection. My brain isn’t broken. It was doing its job far too well. It had known that holding onto everything would have completely annihilated me, so it had to let some details go. It kept only what was essential… how to breathe, how to get through the day, how not to collapse and completely fall apart. 

In that sense, forgetting was an act of mercy to my own self. 

There’s grief in the forgetting itself, of course. A sort of secondary loss. I do mourn the version of me who lived those years consciously, who might have remembered conversations, mornings, everyday joys. There are friendships and moments I know mattered that now exist only as faint impressions left on my brain.

Grief scrambled my sense of time. I don’t expect my memories to obey it.
Memory is not a moral trait. Forgetting doesn’t mean you didn’t care enough, love enough, try hard enough. Sometimes it means you cared so deeply that your mind chose survival over the possibility of being hurt the same way again.

Those missing years weren’t empty. They were heavy. They were full of life, and love, and laughter

Even if I can only remember when reminded.`

    body: `The sky is so tragically beautiful. A graveyard of stars.

There’s something tragic about our solar system.

There was once a time the sky would be crowded and unapologetically messy with light. Millions of stars soaring over our heads. Entire constellations sprawled across a dark abyss. The dark didn’t feel empty. It felt alive.

Now, when I look up, I see nothing, replaced by a never-ending trail of melancholy streetlights and mega LED billboards.

Something that should feel infinite now feels sanitised.

That’s not to say it isn’t beautiful. Because it is.

Light pollution.

It’s taken something ancient from me. Not loudly or violently... slowly and gradually.

The term “A graveyard of stars” has been on my mind lately. Not because the stars are gone, they’re still here. We just can’t see them anymore. Buried under safety, visibility, and convenience.

How did we trade awe for progression?

Yikes. Kinda reminds me of myself.

Have I learnt to dim parts of myself over time?

Habits that once felt like protection now feel like erasure. I withdraw when connection feels risky. I push people away before they get the chance to leave.

It’s like I’ve built an endless path of emotional lamp posts. bright, detached, hyper-independent, so no one can see what’s underneath. My very own graveyard of stars.

But depth still exists. I know this because there are people who still see my constellations. Friends. Family. Like the few places on Earth where the stars still spill across the sky in an impossible abundance.

Bad habits are like an internal light pollution. Small at first. Missed texts. Cancelled plans. Distance over vulnerability. Until it accumulates into an iron dome.

You look functional. Bright, even.

But something ancient is missing.

Stars.

Neither loss is irreversible. The stars never left, because if the lights went out, they’d return in overwhelming beauty. The sky would remember itself.

People are the same.

Instead of adding more armour, we remove it and turn off the lights. We sit with the dark long enough for our constellations to reappear.

The sky didn’t ruin itself.

And if we’re honest... neither did we.`

    body: `I move on wheels,
but I’m going forward,
learning, growing,
finding my place at university halls and quiet nights.

My chair tells a story,
not of limits,
but of strength that learned new ways
to rise every day.

I share my journey openly,
for anyone who feels tired,
lost, or unsure
hoping my words become a hand to hold.

I give my time, my care, my truth,
to those who see me clearly,
not for what I lack,
but for what I offer freely.

I am here to help,
to lift, to listen,
to remind others
we are more than what tried to stop us.`

    body: `Mi abuela olvidó los nombres,
pero no olvidó la espera.
Se le borraron los días,
pero no el “ya vuelve”.

Mi abuelo murió
y ella se quedó en la puerta,
con la memoria hecha humo
y el corazón intacto.

Un año lo buscó en la tarde,
en la silla, en la mesa,
en el ruido de la calle.

One year later she passed away…
yo digo:
un año después,
por fin se lo encontró.`

  excerpt: "tiny, near-invisible moments where meaning silently lives.",
  body: `I think I pay attention to the most random things.

Like the way someone’s nose flares when they talk about music that they love.. barely noticeable, unless you’re looking for it.

Or how certain afternoons linger in your mind for no specific reason,
like taking out my bright pink Pusheen lunchbox… something you’d expect to feel embarrassing, but didn’t.

It’s odd not feeling judged for things you thought you would be, especially in hindsight.

What lingers isn’t the music itself, especially when you don’t understand the words, 
but the way it’s shared, 
the enthusiasm hidden under a blanket of nonchalance.

Minute details.
Things you wouldn’t notice unless you were purposefully observing.

I think that’s where meaning is
not in giant gestures,
but in the near invisible moments
where someone is simply, unintentionally, themselves.`
