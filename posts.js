    body: `This space is a quiet place for my words.

We’re part of a creative writing club, and this blog exists as a home for the things we write — poems, short reflections, little slivers of thought, and pieces that start life in a physical journal before finding their way here.

Some entries are recent. Some were written months, possibly even years ago, and shared later. Posts appear when they were written, not when they were uploaded.

If you’re reading this, thank you for taking the time to sit with our work.

Love,
Marian, Gloria, Zeynep, Ian, Julian, and Tristan

    excerpt: "On grief, memory loss, and the years my mind refused to archive.",
    body: `There are entire years of my life I cannot access without physical proof.

From around 2021 to 2023, my memory didn’t so much fade as it caved in on itself. When people ask what I was doing then, who I was seeing, how I felt… I reach for answers the way you reach for a light switch in a room you know is familiar, only to find there’s nothing there. No light switch. Just the outline of things that must have existed.

This isn’t forgetfulness in its usual sense. It’s not misplacing your house keys or forgetting your neighbour’s name. It’s the absence of character and texture. No order. No emotional progression. Time happened — clearly — my body aged, my phone filled up, my life moved forward, but my mind refused to archive it.

Grief did that.

We talk about grief as sadness, longing, pain. We don’t talk enough about how it erases. How it quietly interferes with the brain’s ability to encode experience. How it says “survival first, memory later… or never”.

During those years, I functioned. I worked, spoke, laughed at socially acceptable moments. I was perceived as “coping”, which is often code for “not making anyone uncomfortable”. But internally, something had completely shut down. My mind stopped filing important moments away because it didn’t trust the future enough to believe they’d ever be needed.

Memory needs safety. Grief annihilates that.

When your nervous system is overwhelmed, the brain prioritises endurance and capability. It narrows your focus to what you need. It dulls sensation. Days blur. Months fold into each other. It’s not that nothing happened — it’s that my mind decided it wasn’t important enough to keep.

I know those years existed because of artefacts.

A photo jolts something loose. A video reanimates a version of myself I don’t remember inhabiting. Sometimes it feels less like nostalgia and more like discovery.

“Oh. I was there.
I had a body then too.”

Without these physical keepsakes, those years may as well dissolve entirely. My memory now relies on external storage — camera rolls, messages, timestamps.

It’s unsettling, realising your own mind can’t be trusted as an archive.

But it’s also tender.

Because forgetting wasn’t failure — it was protection. My brain chose survival over total collapse.

There is grief in the forgetting itself. A secondary loss. I mourn the version of me who lived those years consciously.

Memory is not a moral trait. Forgetting doesn’t mean you didn’t care enough. Sometimes it means you cared so deeply that your mind chose endurance.

Those missing years weren’t empty. They were heavy. They were full of life, and love, and laughter —

even if I can only remember when I’m reminded.`

    excerpt: "On light pollution, lost wonder, and the parts of ourselves we dim to survive.",
    body: `The sky is so tragically beautiful. A graveyard of stars.

There’s something tragic about our solar system.

There was once a time the sky would be crowded and unapologetically messy with light. Millions of stars soaring over our heads. Entire constellations sprawled across a dark abyss. The dark didn’t feel empty. It felt alive.

Now, when I look up, I see nothing — replaced by a never-ending trail of melancholy streetlights and LED billboards.

Something that should feel infinite now feels sanitised.

That’s not to say it isn’t beautiful. Because it is.

Light pollution.

It’s taken something ancient from me. Not loudly or violently — slowly, gradually.

“A graveyard of stars” has been on my mind lately. Not because the stars are gone — they’re still here. We just can’t see them anymore. Buried under safety, visibility, and convenience.

How did we trade awe for progression?

Yikes. That reminds me of myself.

Have I learnt to dim parts of myself over time?

Habits that once felt like protection now feel like erasure. I withdraw when connection feels risky. I push people away before they get the chance to leave.

It’s like I’ve built an endless path of emotional lamp posts — bright, detached, hyper-independent — so no one can see what’s underneath. My own graveyard of stars.

But depth still exists. I know this because there are people who still see my constellations. Friends. Family. Like the few places on Earth where the stars still spill across the sky in impossible abundance.

Bad habits are internal light pollution. Small at first. Missed texts. Cancelled plans. Distance over vulnerability — just this once. Until it accumulates into an iron dome.

You look functional. Bright, even.

But something ancient is missing.

Stars.

Neither loss is irreversible. The stars never left. If the lights went out, they’d return in overwhelming beauty. The sky would remember itself.

People are the same.

Instead of adding more armour, we remove it. We turn the lights off. We sit with the dark long enough for our constellations to reappear.

The sky didn’t ruin itself.

And if we’re honest... neither did we.`
